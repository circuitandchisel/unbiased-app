/** Attaching an image the app cannot decode.
 *
 *  Measured 2026-09-09: a user attached a WebP logo and asked for it to be
 *  redrawn in a design app. Electron's nativeImage cannot decode WebP, so the
 *  extension said "image" and the decode said "empty"; the record fell
 *  through to `kind: "file"`, went to the engine as a text mention, and the
 *  engine dropped the binary without a word. The model's context held zero
 *  images. It inferred the subject from the target frame's NAME, drew the mark
 *  from memory, and reported success — the only failure in the series that
 *  produced a WRONG result rather than a slow one.
 *
 *  macOS ships `sips`, which converts the file in about 60ms. So a format the
 *  extension promises but the app cannot read is converted to PNG and the
 *  converted copy is attached instead. */

/** Bitmap formats worth attaching as pixels. The last five are here precisely
 *  because Electron may fail on them: WebP always, HEIC/AVIF depending on the
 *  build, TIFF sometimes. SVG is deliberately absent — it is a vector, and
 *  `sips` cannot rasterise it either, so pretending would only cost a failed
 *  subprocess on every attach. */
