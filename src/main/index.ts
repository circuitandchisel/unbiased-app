  // licence to switch routes.
  "A route the task ruled out is not a fallback. If the app's own tools cannot do what was asked the way it was " +

  // Calendar app for 27 seconds, on a turn where the toggle was not even on —
  // the sentence was still in context from earlier turns.

  // frame's NAME, drew the mark from memory, and reported success — the one
  // failure in this whole series that produced a wrong result rather than a
  // slow one. Nothing in the tools could have caught it; only the model knows
  // its own context is missing the thing the task is about.

  /**
   * Rewrite a task's prompt with the model, grounded in screenshots.
   *
   * Exists because of a measured failure, not as a nicety: the Slack task
   * flailed for ten minutes — seventy-plus blind keypresses — because its
   * prompt said "set your status" without knowing what that UI looks like.
   * Screenshots turned into exact labels and stop rules are the repair.
   *
   * Design rules, each load-bearing:
   *  - AUGMENT, never replace. Wholesale rewrites drop the constraints the
   *    user tuned by hand (required phrases, tone). The instructions demand
   *    the user's intent and exact required wording survive verbatim.
   *  - Proposed, never applied. This returns text; the form shows old vs new
   *    and the user accepts or discards. A prompt that runs unattended for
   *    months must never change to something nobody read.
   *  - Ephemeral thread. Tuning is authoring-time tooling — it must not
   *    leave a conversation in the sidebar or survive a restart.
   *  - Interrupt on timeout, learned the hard way: a cap that only stops the
   *    app watching leaves the engine running invisibly.
