# Unbiased

Unbiased desktop — a Pareto-powered coding agent in an Electron shell. The
app is a pure client: all agent intelligence lives in a separate
[`unbiased-app-engine`](https://github.com/circuitandchisel/unbiased-app-engine)
binary (a Pareto-locked codex app-server wrapper) that the app spawns and
speaks to over stdio.

**New here?** [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) explains the whole
chain — UI, supervisor, codex app-server, gateway — and traces one message
from keystroke to file on disk.

## Install

Unbiased requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 12 or newer. Download
the latest build from
[unbiased-app-releases](https://github.com/circuitandchisel/unbiased-app-releases/releases/latest),
or use the verified installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/circuitandchisel/unbiased-app-releases/main/install.sh | bash
```

On first launch, choose **Sign in with browser** to select an Unbiased
workload, or paste an existing Unbiased API key. Desktop-control features ask
for macOS Accessibility or Screen Recording access only when they need it.

Agent Browser includes a pinned control binary and a Chrome for Testing
fallback, so no Homebrew installation is needed. On macOS 12, Chrome for
Testing is no longer supported; Agent Browser uses an installed Chrome,
Chromium, Brave, or Edge browser instead.

## Features

- **Streaming chat** with markdown rendering, Prism-highlighted code
  blocks, elapsed-time "thinking" indicator, and turn interruption.
- **Supervised agent loop** — commands the agent wants to run surface as
  cards with Approve/Decline buttons; consecutive steps fold into a
  collapsible group with per-step output. Threads run with an `untrusted`
  approval policy and a `read-only` sandbox.
- **Projects & Recents sidebar** — chats bound to a chosen project folder
  group under it (hover ✎ starts a new chat there); plain chats pin to the
  home directory and list under Recents.
- **Side chat** — an ephemeral fork of the main conversation (full context
  copied; the engine forgets it on exit). Select any text to *Ask in side
  chat*, or *Add to chat* to stage it as an annotation.
- **Annotations** — Codex-style: an inline comment box on the selection,
  numbered badges pinned to the excerpts (CSS Custom Highlight API keeps
  them tinted), multiple annotations ride the next send.
- **Attachments** — files/folders via the composer's **+** menu (sent as
  engine `mention` items) and images via clipboard paste or file pick
  (sent as `localImage`, so the model sees pixels). Cards show thumbnails;
  clicking one previews full-size in the side panel.
- **Files view** (project chats only) — a split pane: file viewer +
  lazy-loading workspace tree with indent guides and a name filter.
  Breadcrumb segments open a sibling-switcher dropdown.
- **Theming** — every chrome shade derives from surface + ink + accent +
  contrast. Settings → Appearance edits them live; `codex-theme-v1:{…}`
  exports import directly.

- `src/main/engine.ts` — `EngineClient`: the only code that knows a child
  process exists. Spawns the engine, correlates requests/responses,
  surfaces notifications and server-initiated requests (approvals).
- `src/main/index.ts` — window, IPC handlers, pane routing (`main`/`side`
  share one engine, keyed by threadId), project persistence, file access.
- `src/preload/index.ts` — the renderer's whole engine surface, typed and
  minimal.
- `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` — the entire UI. No CSS files; styling is
  inline against CSS variables set from the active theme.

For what sits *below* this diagram — what the engine wrapper does, what the
codex app-server owns, how a turn reaches the model, and where conversations
live on disk — see [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

## Development

Requires Node.js 22 and sibling checkouts of the engine and accessibility
bridge:

```
Work/
├── unbiased-app/          # this repo
├── unbiased-app-engine/   # run `make bundle` there first
└── unbiased-ax/           # run `make bundle` there first
```

```bash
# 1. Build the native bundles (once, and after native changes)
cd ../unbiased-app-engine && make bundle
cd ../unbiased-ax && make bundle

# 2. Install and run
cd ../unbiased-app
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`UNBIASED_ENGINE_DIR` overrides the engine location for testing. In a
packaged app the engine is expected beside the app in `extraResources`.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build      # electron-vite production build → out/
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npx electron .     # run the built app
```
