# How Unbiased App works

A high-level tour of what happens between typing a message and a file
appearing on disk. Read this before changing anything that crosses a layer
boundary; `README.md` covers the app's own source layout in more detail.

## The short version

Unbiased is a **client**. It draws the interface and owns nothing about
being an agent: no model calls, no tool execution, no conversation storage.
All of that belongs to an engine the app launches as a child process.

```

Everything above the gateway line ships inside the `.app`. There is nothing
else to install.

## The layers

### 1. The renderer — the entire UI

One React file (`src/renderer/src/App.tsx`) draws everything: the sidebar,
chat, side panel, diff review, file tree, terminal, and settings. There are
no CSS files; styling is inline against CSS variables set from the active
theme. It has no direct access to Node, the filesystem, or the engine — it
can only call what the preload exposes.

### 2. The main process — everything privileged

`src/main/index.ts` owns the window, and every capability the renderer
can't have itself: reading files, running `git`, spawning terminal shells,
the embedded browser, the API key, and the child engine process.
`src/main/engine.ts` is the only code that knows a child process exists —
it spawns the engine, matches replies to requests, and forwards the
engine's notifications onward.

`src/main/model-routing.ts` explicitly selects `pareto-26.10-preview` for
thread creation, resume, fork, and every new turn. A saved conversation can
retain an older model even after the supervisor's default changes, so new
turns must carry the explicit model too.

If a preview turn terminates with a service/transport failure before any
model output, reasoning, tool activity, or approval request, the app makes
one continuation on the `pareto` alias. The engine has already saved the
user message; the continuation sends empty input rather than adding that
message or its attachments twice. Approval, sandbox, and effort settings
are preserved. A later user turn tries the preview again.

Fallback is limited to structured connection/stream failures with HTTP
404, 408, 500, 502, 503, or 504, a connection failure without an HTTP status,
or `serverOverloaded`. It does not bypass authentication, quota/rate limits,
context limits, cancellation, compaction/busy errors, or tool failures. The
alias is resolved by the gateway and is not guaranteed to be a different
backend. This is error recovery, not a timer that retries a slow request.

The routing tests include a mock JSON-RPC engine. To also exercise the real
bundled engine against a local mock HTTP API (no production inference), run:

```sh
UNBIASED_TEST_APP_SERVER=/absolute/path/to/pareto-app-server node --import tsx --test src/main/model-routing.integration.test.ts
```

`src/preload/index.ts` is the seam: a small, typed `window.unbiased` object
that is the renderer's complete view of the world.

### 3. `unbiased-app-engine` — the supervisor

A small Go program (the separate
[`unbiased-app-engine`](https://github.com/circuitandchisel/unbiased-app-engine)
repository) whose whole job is to make the
engine **Pareto-only by construction**. On every launch it:

- resolves your API key — `UNBIASED_API_KEY`, else `~/.unbiased/credentials.json`
- rewrites `~/.unbiased/app-engine/home/config.toml` from a template, pinning
  its default Pareto model and the gateway URL; the app explicitly selects
  the conversation model as described above
- launches the real engine with `CODEX_HOME` pointed at that directory

Because the config is regenerated every start and the engine never reads
`~/.codex`, no leftover user configuration can point it at another provider,
and an upgrade can't inherit stale settings.

### 4. `pareto-app-server` — the actual agent

This is OpenAI's Codex app-server (Rust), pinned by version and checksum in
the engine repo's `engine.lock`. It is the brain:

- owns conversations (threads, turns, history, on-disk storage)
- assembles every request to the model — system prompt, history, tools
- runs **the agent loop**: the model asks for a tool, the engine executes it,
  feeds the result back, and repeats
- enforces the sandbox and raises approval requests
- summarizes history when the context window fills (compaction)

The app talks to it over newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout —
`thread/start`, `turn/start`, `item/*` notifications, and server-initiated
requests when something needs your approval.

### Beyond the app: the gateway

`api.unbiased.ai` fronts the Unbiased gateway, which resolves the model name
`pareto` to a deployment and forwards the call. Today that path runs through
a router into a **cascade**: cheap models answer easy requests, and harder or
tool-heavy ones escalate to frontier models. From the app's point of view
none of this is visible — it asks for `pareto` and gets an answer.

## Following one message end to end

You type *"Create a file named demo.py"* and press Enter.

1. **Renderer → main.** The composer calls `sendMessage`, which crosses the
   preload into `chat:send`.
2. **Main → engine.** If the conversation is new, the app calls
   `thread/start` with the working directory and the current access mode,
   then `turn/start` with your text.
3. **Engine → gateway.** The engine builds an OpenAI *Responses* API call and
   POSTs it to `api.unbiased.ai/v1/responses`. The body is mostly not your
   message: ~20 KB of Codex system instructions, an environment block (cwd,
   shell, date, sandbox policy), the tool definitions, and finally your
   sentence.
4. **Model replies with an intent, not prose.** It returns a *tool call* —
   e.g. `exec_command` with `{"cmd": "touch demo.py"}`.
5. **Engine checks the sandbox.** Allowed under the current mode? Run it.
   Needs more access? Pause and ask you (an approval card appears).
6. **Engine runs it and loops.** The command's output is appended to the
   conversation and sent back to the model, which decides what to do next.
   This repeats until the model answers instead of calling a tool.
7. **Streaming back.** Throughout, the engine emits notifications — message
   deltas, command cards, plan updates, token usage — which the main process
   forwards to the renderer, which draws them.

The important line: **the model never touches your machine.** It can only
ask the engine to act, and the engine decides whether that's allowed.

## The sandbox and access modes

Every turn carries a sandbox policy and an approval policy. The app exposes
three combinations:

| Mode | Reads | Writes in the project | Network / outside the project |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ask for approval | free | asks | asks |
| Approve for me | free | **runs** | asks (network is allowed) |
| Full access | free | runs | runs |

Plan mode overrides all of it with a read-only policy for the turn.

Approvals are a *server-initiated request*: the engine blocks the turn, the
app renders a card, and your decision is sent back as the reply. Declining
is a normal answer, not an error.

## Where things live on disk

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.unbiased/credentials.json` | your API key (shared with the CLI) |
| `~/.unbiased/app-engine/home/` | the engine's home: generated config, session logs, state DB |
| `…/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` | append-only log of every conversation, by thread id |
| `<userData>/transcripts/` | the app's own rendered-transcript cache |
| `<userData>/worktrees.json` | git worktrees created per conversation |
| `<userData>/thread-mcp.json` | which MCP servers each conversation has turned on |
| `<userData>/window-state.json` | window size and position |

Rollouts only ever grow — compaction shortens what's *sent to the model*,
not what's on disk. Settings → Resources shows the real footprint per
conversation.

## An attached image the app cannot decode is converted, not degraded

Attachments reach the engine two ways: an image goes as a `localImage` item
(the model sees pixels), anything else goes as a `mention` for thread history.
The model does not see local file mentions on their own, so the app also sends
the complete contents of small UTF-8 files or an explicit absolute path with
instructions to inspect larger files, folders, and other formats. Folders are
identified from the filesystem; image files are checked with Electron's
`nativeImage` decoder — and Electron cannot decode WebP, nor HEIC
or AVIF on every build.

Measured 2026-09-09: a WebP logo was attached with "draw this icon as is".
The extension said image, the decode said empty, the record fell through to
`kind: "file"`, and the engine dropped the binary mention without a word. The
model's context held **zero** images (verified in the rollout: no
`input_image` item, and the string "webp" appears nowhere in the session). It
inferred the subject from the target frame's NAME, drew the mark from memory,
and reported success. Every other failure in this series was slow; this one
was wrong.

So a file whose extension promises pixels but which fails to decode is
converted to PNG with `sips -s format png` and the converted copy is attached
instead — verified on that exact file: empty before, 1280x1280 after. The
destination is derived from the source path, so a re-attach reuses it; the
card still shows the original filename; and if there is no `sips` or the
format is genuinely unreadable it falls back to a file mention as before,
with a line in the diagnostic log either way. SVG is excluded on purpose: it
is a vector and `sips` cannot rasterise it, so trying would only cost a failed
subprocess on every attach.

The model side is covered too, because no tool can detect this: the per-turn
computer directive now says to work only from what is actually in front of it,
and to say an image did not arrive rather than reconstruct it from memory or
from a file or frame name.

## MCP servers are per conversation

Every MCP server the engine connects to puts its whole tool schema in front
of the model on every request. Measured 2026-09-09 on a drawing task: the
first request was 56,495 tokens before the model said a word, and about 35k
of that was four servers the task never used — Figma remote 41 tools,
Honeycomb 23, PostHog 1, Figma desktop 10. The window is 124,518 and
compaction arms at 96,000, so most of the working room was gone at hello.

So a server is off in every conversation until it is switched on for that
one. The app keeps the set per ROOT thread in `thread-mcp.json` and passes
`config: { mcp_servers: { <name>: { enabled: false } } }` for every server
not in it — on `thread/start`, `thread/resume` and `thread/fork` alike, all
three of which accept the override. Side chats and sub-agents key off the
root, so they see what their conversation sees. Scheduled and authoring
threads get everything off.

One server cannot be switched this way: a connector carrying an OAuth client
secret (the Google ones) is written into the engine's config as a managed
plugin, not as an `[mcp_servers.*]` table. Naming it in the override invents
a server with no transport and every turn dies with `failed to load
configuration: invalid transport` — measured 2026-09-09, by doing exactly
that. `overridableServerNames` mirrors the wrapper's own rule
(`renderMCPServers`/`managedPluginServers` in `internal/engine/mcp.go`), and
the panel offers a switch only for the servers it returns.

Two engine facts shape how a switch mid-conversation works, both measured
against the pinned 0.147 binary:

- `thread/resume` on a thread the engine has already LOADED hands back the
  loaded session and ignores `config`. Only an unloaded thread reads it.
- `thread/unsubscribe` followed by `thread/resume` re-creates the session
  with the new set in about two seconds — same thread id, history intact,
  and only the newly enabled server reports `starting` → `ready`.

Hence the apply path: unsubscribe, then resume with the new override. It
cannot run mid-turn (the resume would kill the turn), so a switch thrown
while a turn is running is queued and flushed on `turn/completed`. A thread
that has never completed a turn has no rollout to resume — the set is saved
and applies the next time it loads.

The composer chip only says "MCP on" or "MCP off" and opens the panel; the
per-server switches live in the MCP panel under `+`, beside the list they
belong to. Adding, removing or signing into a server still edits the
engine's own config and still needs the engine restart that panel offers —
that is a different layer from choosing among servers the engine already
knows.

## Signing in

The engine refuses to start without an API key, so the app gates on it. Two
ways in:

- **Sign in with your browser.** The app asks the platform for a one-time
  code (the platform's RFC 8628 device authorization flow — see
  `docs/partner-device-flow.md` in unbiased-platform), opens the platform's
  `/activate` page in your own browser, where you already have a session,
  and shows you the code to confirm there. Once you approve, the platform
  mints a key for the workload you picked and the app collects it by polling;
  the key itself never passes through the browser. The app is a registered
  OAuth *public* client (`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `src/main/index.ts`): the id
  is public by design and your approval in the browser is what carries the
  trust. `src/main/device-auth.ts` is the transport.
- **Paste a key.** Create one in the dashboard and paste it in.

Either way the key is validated against the platform's `/api/cli/whoami`
(free, no model call) and only then is the engine started with that key
pinned into its environment. Sign out stops the engine and removes the stored
key.

For development, `UNBIASED_PLATFORM_URL` points the app at a local platform
and `UNBIASED_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` overrides the client id.

## Releases and updates

`npm run dist` produces a single arm64 DMG with the engine inside it,
ad-hoc signed (the build fails if the signature doesn't verify). Pushing a
`v*` tag runs the release workflow, which builds on macOS and publishes
cross-repo to the public `unbiased-app-releases`.

In-app updates are two-phase: the app downloads and checksums the new build
into a hidden staged copy beside itself, then swaps it in and relaunches
when you choose. Applying is a single `mv`, so the moment where the app
could be left broken is milliseconds rather than the length of a 190 MB
copy.
